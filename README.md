# supercalcs

**supercalcs** is a repository containing my current working notes for calculating the electromagnetic properties of superconducting thin films. It is based primarily, for the time being, around two key areas:

1. Calculations of the inductances and attenuation constant for a thin film CPW resonator, following the derivations of <https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4773070> "Clem, Journal of Applied Physics 113, 013910 (2013)"
