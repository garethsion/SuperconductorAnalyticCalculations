# supercalcs

**supercalcs** is a repository containing my current working notes for calculating the electromagnetic properties of superconducting thin films. It is based primarily, for the time being, around two key areas:

1. Calculations of the inductances and attenuation constant for a thin film CPW resonator, following the derivations of <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4773070">Clem, Journal of Applied Physics 113, 013910 (2013)</a>

2. Calculations of the Mattis-Bardeen kernel, allowing for the derivation of superconducting properties such as surface imoedance and effective penetration depth.

This repository is a work in progress, and contains my notes and derivations in a rough, working format. There undoubtedly will be errors and poor code here and there.
