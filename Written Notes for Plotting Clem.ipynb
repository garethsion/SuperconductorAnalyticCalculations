    "We're particularly interested in the condition where $\\lambda \\gg 2a$, when the kinetic inductance is expected to be much greater that the geometric inductance. In this case, the equation $L'_{k} \\approx (\\mu_{0}\\Lambda/4a) g_{\\epsilon}(k,\\epsilon)$ cannot be used, since it is only a good approximation when both $d \\ll \\lambda$ and $\\epsilon \\approx \\lambda^{2}/da \\ll 1$. The equation for the geometric inductance is no longer valid also, since it's derivation required the assumption that $\\lambda^{2}/d \\ll (b-a)$, so that the field was confined entierly to the slots. So, to deal with a film of an arbitrary value of $\\Lambda = 2\\lambda^{2}/d$, including the case for $\\lambda>2a$, a new approach is required to obtain a good estimate of $L'_{m}$ and $L'_{k}$, which was provided by Clem."
